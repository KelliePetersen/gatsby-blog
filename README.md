## Simple Gatsby Blog

This blog is built using **Contentful** for the blog posts and **Netlify** to deploy it.  

To run the site: ```gatsby develop```  
To view  the site: `http://localhost:8000`  
GraphQL Playground: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`  

Blog posts are edited and changed on the Contentful site.  
When you edit or add a new blog post, you must redeploy the website on Netlify.
